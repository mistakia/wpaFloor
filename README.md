# wpaFloor

wpaFloor is an [openframeworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) app that uses two kinects to create an interactive projection using two projectors with madmapper. I used two kinect v1 (Model 1414) and two InFocus IN138HDST projectors. The projectors and kinects were mounted on the ceiling with the projectors pointing down but angled up (~30Â°) to minimize shadows. You will need to adjust the positioning of the kinect depth images inside the app.
